# Forming Worlds Lab

Welcome to the code hub of the Forming Worlds Lab, a cross-disciplinary and multi-national team of researchers investigating the formation and evolution of rocky exoplanets and terrestrial worlds of the Solar System. This platform hosts a number of planetary simulation codes.

[**PROTEUS**](https://github.com/FormingWorlds/PROTEUS)  
Coupled atmosphere-interior framework to simulate the temporal evolution of rocky planets.
 
[**AEOLUS**](https://github.com/FormingWorlds/AEOLUS)  
1-D radiative-convective model of planetary atmospheres that makes use of the SOCRATES radiative transfer code.
 
[**i2elvis_planet**](https://github.com/FormingWorlds/i2elvis_planet)  
2-D fluid mechanics and thermochemistry of planetesimals and protoplanets.

All codes hosted publicly here are open for collaboration. If you have specific questions or suggestions, please create a [Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/FormingWorlds/discussions), an `Issue` in the respective repository, or reach out via email to contact@formingworlds.space.
