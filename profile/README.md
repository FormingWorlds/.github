# Forming Worlds Lab

Welcome to the code hub of the [Forming Worlds Lab](https://www.formingworlds.space), a cross-disciplinary and multi-national team of researchers investigating the formation and evolution of rocky exoplanets and terrestrial worlds of the Solar System. This platform hosts a number of open source planetary simulation codes, which we develop and/or contribute to. All codes are executable stand-alone.

[**PROTEUS**](https://github.com/FormingWorlds/PROTEUS)  
*Coupled atmosphere-interior framework to simulate the temporal evolution of rocky planets.*
([Development Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/FormingWorlds/projects/7))
 
[**JANUS**](https://github.com/FormingWorlds/JANUS)  
*1-D convective model of planetary atmospheres, designed for integration into [PROTEUS](https://github.com/FormingWorlds/PROTEUS).*

[**MORS**](https://github.com/FormingWorlds/MORS)  
*Model for the rotation and flux evolution of stars, adapted for integration into [PROTEUS](https://github.com/FormingWorlds/PROTEUS).*

[**SOCRATES**](https://github.com/FormingWorlds/SOCRATES)  
*Atmospheric radiative transfer code, adapted for integration into [PROTEUS](https://github.com/FormingWorlds/PROTEUS).*

[**AGNI**](https://github.com/nichollsh/AGNI)  
*Atmospheric radiative-convective solver, designed for integration into [PROTEUS](https://github.com/FormingWorlds/PROTEUS).*

[**SPIDER**](https://github.com/djbower/spider)  
*1-D parameterised interior dynamics code for rocky planets with molten and/or solid interiors, adapted for integration into [PROTEUS](https://github.com/FormingWorlds/PROTEUS).*

[**i2elvis_planet**](https://github.com/FormingWorlds/i2elvis_planet)  
*2-D fluid mechanics and thermochemistry of planetesimals and protoplanets.*

[**Erebus.jl**](https://github.com/FormingWorlds/Erebus.jl)  
*2-D hydro-thermo-mechanical-chemical geodynamic numerical code with a focus on thermodynamic reactions in a two-phase model.*

All codes hosted publicly here are open for collaboration and are under active development for the purpose of scientific research. _If you see new changes pushed to one of the repositories that are not yet linked to a journal publication and you want to make use of these, please do reach out to the authors first._ If you have any questions or suggestions, please either create a [Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/FormingWorlds/discussions), an `Issue` in the respective repository, or reach out via email to contact@formingworlds.space.
