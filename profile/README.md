# Forming Worlds Lab

Welcome to the code hub of the [Forming Worlds Lab](https://www.formingworlds.space), an interdisciplinary and multi-national team of researchers investigating the formation and evolution of rocky exoplanets and terrestrial worlds of the Solar System. This platform hosts a number of open source planetary simulation codes, which we develop and/or substantially contribute to. All codes are executable stand-alone, are open for collaboration and are under active development for the purpose of scientific research. _If you see new changes pushed to one of the repositories that are not yet linked to a journal publication and you want to make use of these, please do reach out to the authors first._ If you have any questions or suggestions, please either create a [Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/FormingWorlds/discussions), an `Issue` in the respective repository, or reach out via email to contact@formingworlds.space.
