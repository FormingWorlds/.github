# Forming Worlds Lab

Welcome to the code hub of the Forming Worlds Lab, a cross-disciplinary and multi-national team of researchers investigating the formation and evolution of rocky exoplanets and terrestrial worlds of the Solar System. This platform hosts a number of open source planetary simulation codes.

[**PROTEUS**](https://github.com/FormingWorlds/PROTEUS)  
*Coupled atmosphere-interior framework to simulate the temporal evolution of rocky planets.*
([Development Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/FormingWorlds/projects/7))
 
[**JANUS**](https://github.com/FormingWorlds/JANUS)  
*1-D prescribed atmosphere model of planetary atmospheres that makes use of the SOCRATES radiative transfer code.*
 
[**i2elvis_planet**](https://github.com/FormingWorlds/i2elvis_planet)  
*2-D fluid mechanics and thermochemistry of planetesimals and protoplanets.*

[**Erebus.jl**](https://github.com/FormingWorlds/Erebus.jl)  
*2-D hydro-thermo-mechanical-chemical geodynamic numerical code with a focus on thermodynamic reactions in a two-phase model.*

All codes hosted publicly here are open for collaboration and are under active development for the purpose of scientific research. _If you see new changes pushed to one of the repositories that are not yet linked to a journal publication and you want to make use of these, please do reach out to the authors first._ If you have any questions or suggestions, please either create a [Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/FormingWorlds/discussions), an `Issue` in the respective repository, or reach out via email to contact@formingworlds.space.
